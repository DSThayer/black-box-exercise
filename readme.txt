Black box exercise Git repository.

Create a file for your team's portion of the exercise.
The file should have a function that meets the specification agreed in class.

Once done, commit this file to Git and push this file to the remote repository. 

The person who is doing this will need to send your github username to Dan first so he can add you to the repository.

Also, you may need to pull first to update your repository to the latest before you can do this (there shouldn't be any conflicts, since different teams are working on different files).
